**Decisions**
* we want to improve the member experience after initial signup. For this we schedule a meeting in September 2020 to create a proper onboarding process.
* we want to clean up the django-cms.org market place. In the future, only members will be listed on the marketplace. dCA community manager will contact all companies that are not dCA members yet with an invitation to become a dCA member.

**Tasks**
* Invite to a meeting for onboarding process brainstorming
* Nicolai to reach out to marketplace companies for dCA membership and report back to the weekly dCA board meeting
